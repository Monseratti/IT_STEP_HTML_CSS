    <!-- First paragraph -->
    <h4>Linear Equations</h4>
    <p>A linear equation is any equation that can be written in the form</p>
    <div>ax + b = 0</div>
    <p>where <b >a</b> and <b>b</b> are real numbers and <b>x</b> is a variable. 
        This form is sometimes called the standard form of a linear equation. 
        Note that most linear equations will not start off in this form. 
        Also, the variable may or may not be an <b>x</b> so don't get too locked into always seeing an <b>x</b> there.</p>
        
    <!-- Second paragraph -->
    <h4>Quadratic Equation</h4>
    <p>The standard form of a quadratic equation looks like this:</p>
    <div>ax<sup>2</sup> + bx + c = 0</div>
    <p>where <b>a</b>, <b>b</b>, <b>c</b> are known values and <b>x</b> 
        is the variable or unknown (we don't know it yet). Also, <b>a</b> can't be 0.</p>

    <!-- Third paragraph -->
    <h4>The area of a circle (A)</h4>
    <p><b>&pi;</b> (Pi) times the radius (<b>r</b>) squared:</p>
    <div>A = &pi; &times; r<sup>2</sup> </div>
    <p>or, when you know the diameter (<b>D</b>):</p>
    <div>A = (&pi;/4) &times; D<sup>2</sup> </div>
    <p>or, when you know the circumference (<b>C</b>):</p>
    <div>A = (C<sup>2</sup>/4) &times; &pi; </div>
    
    <!-- Four paragraph -->
    <h4>Intersection</h4>
    <p>The intersection of two sets <b>A</b> and <b>B</b>, denoted by A  B, 
        is the set of all objects that are members of both the sets A and B. In symbols,</p>
    <div style="margin-left: 40%; margin-right: 40%;">A &Intersection; B = { x : x &in; A and x &in; B }</div>
    <p>That is, <b>x</b> is an element of the intersection A &Intersection; B if and only if <b>x</b> is both an element of <b>A</b> and an element of <b>B</b>.</p>
